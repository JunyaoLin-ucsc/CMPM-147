				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I tried to use a program to replicate a landscape image and highlight the key points of the image as much as possible. In this experiment, I used p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, to convert simple code into a dynamic and textured landscape. Since my image was complex, I split it into many different parts and then painted and used layers to express the primary and secondary content of the image. Then, the valley, sky and snow-capped mountains in the distance all used irregular lines to express the authenticity and randomness of the distant peaks.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This script utilizes p5.js to procedurally create a layered, animated scene with randomness evolving over time. It begins by seeding the random number generator to provide reproducibility, allowing controlled variations every time the “reimagine” button is pressed. The terrain is generated by specifying a series of points across the canvas to plot the mountain base and the overlying snow cap. The silhouette of the mountains is shaped by a sine wave function, creating the illusion of a natural, undulating form that simulates a snow-covered surface. The clouds are animated using ellipses, whose horizontal positions drift across the screen at a constant velocity with a sinusoidal offset based on the current frame’s time value. Trees are randomly distributed between the mountains and the road, with slight vertical oscillations added to simulate a gentle sway. The road is a static, slanted quadrilateral filling the lower half of the canvas, decorated with solid yellow lines and dashed white lines. The dashed lines are produced by linearly interpolating along the midpoints of the yellow lines and then using vector arithmetic to offset and thicken the dash segments as required. The final result is a dynamic horizon that captures the essence of natural variability by blending deterministic geometry, noise-derived randomization, and sine oscillation to build up a richly structured landscape.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I only know that it was very tiring to finish this project, because there were a lot of things generated and many parameters needed to be adjusted slightly to get the right result. It took me about 8 hours to produce the result. If I had more time, I would fine-tune the color content and try to enrich other details of the picture!</p>
