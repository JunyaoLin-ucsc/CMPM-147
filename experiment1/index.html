			<h1>Experiment 1 - Suspicious Restaurant Menu Generator</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div class="minor-section">
          <button id="clicker">Reroll it!</button>
          <div id="box"></div>
      </div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>
			</div>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I developed a dynamic text generator that creates a “suspicious restaurant menu.” 
					The generator assembles various descriptive elements using a simple grammar structure to produce a unique, whimsical menu 
					item each time the user clicks the button. Originally built on Glitch, this project was redesigned and integrated into my 
					personal portfolio.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery used for DOM manipulation and event handling. 
					It operates by defining arrays of words (fillers) for different components of a menu item, then uses a template string 
					with placeholders that are replaced by randomly selected words. A regular expression searches for these placeholders in the 
					template, and each click of the "Reroll It!" button triggers the regeneration of the text. The code was originally developed on Glitch and later migrated to a local static page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was an excellent opportunity to practice dynamic content generation and the integration of third-party 
					platforms into a local environment. I encountered challenges with adapting the Glitch development process to a standalone 
					static webpage, particularly in managing file paths and load orders. Through this process, I deepened my understanding of 
					jQuery for handling events and DOM updates, and I learned how to troubleshoot issues that arise during code migration. 
					Overall, it improved my skills in web development and prepared me for more complex projects in the future.</p>
