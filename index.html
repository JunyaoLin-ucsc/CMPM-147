					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello World! My name is Junyao, you can spell it like "June-yao", I am a 3rd year majoring in Computer Science: Game Design. I really like play some competitive games like Counter Strike 2, Valorant, League of Legends, etc. Also, I play some casual games like Honkai Star Rail, Lethal Company, R.E.P.O., etc. I have some experience with C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. And I have some experience with Phaser 3, GDevelop 5 and Twine to make 2D games. I really like Electric Dance Music (EDM) Martin Garrix is the best !!!!! and I also made some demo by using FL Studio 2024, I am still a starter and I am keep learning how to use it better. Also, I almost handle all the sound effects and background music with my past projects, so, I don't need to worry about the copyright and I can credit myself!!! </p>
